            Empowering Community to Learn, Grow, and Thrive<br /><br />
            Educational outreach refers to efforts made by educational institutions, organizations, or individuals to engage
            with communities beyond their immediate academic setting. These efforts aim to share knowledge, resources,
            and opportunities with various groups, such as students, teachers, parents, and the general public, to promote
            learning, skill development, and awareness.
